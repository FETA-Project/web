# Catalog and Analysis of Datasets

To provide a comprehensive overview of the available datasets for network traffic analysis, we have created a catalog of datasets. This catalog contains not only the datasets created within this project but also other publicly available datasets. For each dataset, the catalog provides basic information, a description, and links for download.

In addition to the catalog, we conducted an analysis of the datasets. The goal of this analysis was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of individual datasets and to provide recommendations for their use. The analysis focused on aspects such as the size of the dataset, the diversity of the traffic, the presence of anomalies, and the quality of the labels.

The results of the analysis are summarized in a comparative table, which allows for an easy comparison of datasets based on selected criteria. This table can help researchers choose the most suitable dataset for their specific research problem.
